    <li>In todays Code Club we are making a 3D maze game using UPBGE, the first few steps of this guide will show you how to install UPBGE</li>
    <li>The best way to run UPBGE is to clone the code using command prompt, you can also download if from the website but this is slower. To download using command prompt press win + R and type cmd, then run the command <i>curl -k -L -o upbge.7z https://github.com/UPBGE/upbge/releases/download/v0.36.1/upbge-0.36.1-windows-x86_64.7z</i></li>
    <li>Or you can visit <a href="https://upbge.org/#/download">https://upbge.org/#/download</a> and press download</li>
    <li>Unzip the file by opening file explorer to the download location, if you used command prompt this will be your user folder, and then right clik on the 7z archive and press extract all</li>
    <li>Navigate to the folder with your extracted files, then open the only folder that is inside of it, launch blender.exe</li>
